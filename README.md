# simple-java-http-request

A simple code that performs HTTP requests in Java by using the built-in Java class **HttpUrlConnection**.

### Challenges:
- Using **HttpUrlConnection** could be quite cumbersome, as it only allow us to perform basic HTTP requestes and does not provide more advanced functionalities such as dedicated methods for adding headers or authentication.
- Adding Request Parameters and reading  response body (or even parsing it to JSON) is not so easy
